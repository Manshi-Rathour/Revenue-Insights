## Problem statement

Atliq Grands, a key player in Indian hospitality for 20 years, is losing market share due to competition and management decisions. To counter this, the managing director plans to incorporate "Business and Data Intelligence." Lacking an in-house team, they've opted to hire a third-party service provider for insights from historical data to regain their position in luxury/business hotels.

### Task List

As a data analyst tasked with leveraging sample data and a provided mock-up dashboard, my responsibilities include:

- Metric Creation: Generate metrics as outlined in the provided metric list.

- Dashboard Development: Create a dashboard that aligns with the stakeholders' mock-up, incorporating the specified metrics for a comprehensive overview.

- Additional Insights: Identify and present insights beyond the specified metric list and mock-up dashboard. This involves exploring patterns, trends, or anomalies in the data that may offer valuable perspectives on business performance.
